The Robusly app is the way to manage, and centralize your online inquiries. The simple to use application helps any freelancer or business owner better obtain the necessary information from potential customers.

The platform is built with a focus on a strong bottom-up SOA model.  The full working platform includes an inquiry submission web application and client-facing iOS application (above).  To support parallel code building and decrease code reuse all microservices are housed on the cloud.

Built entirely in-house with a powerful scalable back-end utilizing the FireBase suite.  Please check out my current website for future updates at <a href="http://robusly.com">Robusly<a/>
